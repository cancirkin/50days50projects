# 50days50projects

Hello to everyone. I started practicing 50 projects 50 days to improve my JavaScript skills. 

# Day 1 - Expanding Cards

Today my first day and I am sharing my first application, can be used as a photo gallery or slider. You just need to change the size.

# Day 2 - Progress Steps

This is my second day. I designed an application that you can use in your form applications or shopping cards.

# Day 3 - Rotating Navigation

I designed a navigation bar with a very nice animation using css. I think it's great to use on blog sites.

# Day 4 - Hidden Search Widget

A very small but equally useful search widget

# Day 5 - Blurry Loading

I have made a great app to beautify the loading animations of your web pages.

# Day 6 - Scroll Animation

I made an application that will make your web pages look more dynamic.
