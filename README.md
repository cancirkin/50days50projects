# 50days50projects

Hello to everyone. I started practicing 50 projects 50 days to improve my JavaScript skills. 

# Day 1 - Expanding Cards

Today my first day and I am sharing my first application, can be used as a photo gallery or slider. You just need to change the size.

# Day 2 - Progress Steps

This is my second day. I designed an application that you can use in your form applications or shopping cards.
